This is an example of what I can do given a restrictive library set (Only base TKinter allowed for GUI display. Not optimal.), and also an example of basic compiler theory understanding.
It can take basic syntax like:

int x = 1
if(x == 2):
x+1
else:
x+2

It will then do basic token analysis and conditional statement parse tree output.
