These projects show a basic understanding of:
- process scheduling (with various different algorithms/implementations)
- multi-threaded processing
- race conditions
- race condition countermeasures (spin/mutex lock, semaphores, etc.).

Do note the random.cpp and random.h files were provided by the course lecturer for performance comparison reasons (this was an exercise in performance optimization).
This was a collaborative project.
