# Work-Sample
This repository is a collection of university assignments and projects done (in full, or in collaboration) by Preston Roberts.

It is organized by topic, and each topic folder has a brief description of what aspects of Computer Science the work relates to.

These are just some work samples and there may be more case-specific examples available upon request, or in application materials. Additionally, projects can be demonstrated and explained by the applicant.

(Also this repository does not include any work related to closed-source programs I've contributed to)

Thank you!
